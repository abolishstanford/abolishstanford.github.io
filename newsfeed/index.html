The review will consider all relevant information, including from community members and organizations, local officials, the Torrance Police Department, individual officers, and more. Hart, who started with the Torrance Police Department in 1988 as a patrol officer and was appointed chief in April, says he is committed to accountability and won&#x27;t &quot;tolerate any form of bigotry, racism, hate, or misconduct.&quot; The state&#x27;s independent review will be conducted by the Department of Justice&#x27;s Civil Rights Enforcement Section, with the assistance of the Division of Law Enforcement.</p></div><h1>officer racism</h1><div class="summary"><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/torrance-police-california-department-under-state-investigation-for-racist-texts-and-excessive-force/ar-AARDtEU?ocid=BingNewsSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Torrance Police: California department under state investigation for racist texts and excessive force</a><p>While no TPD officers currently face criminal charges for the racist text messages, prosecutors said they will continue to investigate previous and ongoing cases the officers have been involved in, the Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s Office told the LA Times. The announcement comes after an investigation by the Los Angeles Times revealed a history of discriminatory text messages reportedly sent between what it says were at least a dozen current and former Torrance police officers and recruits, including a photo of Black men being lynched with the caption &quot;hanging with the homies.&quot; The LA Times reports that its investigation of use-of-force records and other court filings also revealed the same Torrance police officers who allegedly sent racist text messages were involved in at least seven use-of-force incidents since 2013.

Hundreds of Southern California criminal cases could be jeopardized after more than a dozen police officers exchanged racist and homophobic text messages, according to an investigation by the Los Angeles Times. The officers -- current and former members and recruits of the Torrance Police Department in Los Angeles County -- traded hateful comments about people of color, particularly Black people, as well as Jews and members of the LGBTQ community. Authorities first discovered the text messages during an investigation into two former Torrance officers who have been charged in connection with allegedly spray-painting a swastika inside a vehicle in January 2020. The messages have already led to the dismissal of at least 85 criminal cases, the Times found, though none of the officers currently face criminal charges in connection with the texts.</p></div><div class="summary"><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/california-ag-to-investigate-torrance-police-over-racist-texts-allegations-of-use-of-force/ar-AARCAfN?ocid=BingNewsSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">California A.G. to investigate Torrance police over racist texts, allegations of use of force</a><p>Bonta said Wednesday he is stepping in to investigate the Torrance Police Department amid allegations of use of force and a bevy of racist text messages--many of which were aimed at Black people and members of the LGBTQ community. The evidence of potential &quot;bias&quot; Bonta speaks of could jeopardize nearly 1,400 cases in which the accused officers were listed as potential witnesses, according to Los Angeles County District Attorney&#x27;s records obtained by the Los Angeles Times. The embattled department has been working to prepare for this investigation for months, said a spokesperson for TPD, amid an internal and administrative investigation sparked by a scandal involving more than a dozen police officers accused of exchanging racist text messages for years. &quot;As Police Chief of the Torrance Police Department, I am committed to accountability, and I will not tolerate any form of bigotry, racism, hate, or misconduct,&quot; Hart said in a statement.

Standt&#x27;s claim expands an already wide array of complaints -- including from activists, journalists and legal observers -- about officers violating people&#x27;s rights and using excessive force during the LAPD&#x27;s crackdown on the protests in Echo Park in March, when activists had gathered to oppose the closure of a homeless encampment around Echo Park Lake. A news photographer was shot in the abdomen with a police projectile while documenting the protest, which police claimed was a mistake, and a Times reporter and other members of the media were among more than 180 people detained or arrested after police declared the protest unlawful and issued the dispersal order. Legal observers with the National Lawyers Guild also alleged being improperly targeted, and attorneys representing Black Lives Matter Los Angeles in a class-action lawsuit around the LAPD&#x27;s handling of the protests over Floyd&#x27;s killing successfully used police use of projectiles in Echo Park to argue for court restrictions on such weapons.

The car was being driven away from the scene of an altercation when Gonzalez allegedly approached the car and fired into the vehicle as the driver was pulling away, striking Rodriguez inside, authorities said. The Long Beach Unified School District and a former safety officer were sued Wednesday by the mother of an 18-year-old woman who was shot to death, allegedly by the officer, while she was a passenger in a car fleeing from him in September. Rodriguez was a passenger in a car driven by Rafeul Chowdhury about 3 p.m. Sept. 27 in the vicinity of Spring Street and Palo Verde Avenue, near Millikan High School, police said previously. Manuela Sahagun, mother of Mona Rodriguez, brought the complaint in Los Angeles County Superior Court, alleging wrongful death, excessive force, negligence and civil rights violations.</p></div><div class="summary"><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/former-county-officer-indicted-police-204708605.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Former county officer indicted after police say he used excessive force against teen girl</a><p>Lt. James Leonard, a county police spokesman, said the department was consistent with the practice involving any criminal investigation, in which police review the accusation until they are able to determine if criminal charges are necessary. A former New Castle County police corporal has been indicted after police say he used excessive force during the arrest of a 16-year-old girl at the department&#x27;s prisoner processing area earlier this year. Michael Carnevale, who police said retired from the department prior to the end of this investigation and before any disciplinary action could be taken, was indicted Monday on misdemeanor charges of offensive touching, official misconduct and falsifying business records. Carnevale, who had been with the department since 2005, completed a single-page crime report detailing a video arraignment, but did not mention any resistance by the victim or any police use of force, the Justice Department said. The investigation into Carnevale&#x27;s actions began on Aug. 31 after a fellow officer witnessed the excessive use of force and reported it to a commander, county police said.</p></div><h1>officer fired</h1><div class="summary"><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/family-angry-expected-misdemeanor-plea-175000005.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Family angry at expected misdemeanor plea deal for fired Colorado officer who tased 75-year-old man</a><p>Some of those never-before-seen images--released by federal prosecutors this week--depicted happier days of the late sex-trafficker&#x27;s romance with his alleged accomplice, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who is accused of helping him groom and abuse four underage girl Opening statements took place Wednesday in a Minneapolis court, where Potter is charged with manslaughter for the shooting of Daunte Wright.
