The Des Moines Police Department Communications Center announced a need for assistance and additional patrol units responded,\\\" police said in a news release. \\\"The preliminary investigation, including witness statements and examination of evidence at the scene, indicates that the officer observed a sedan-style vehicle driving northbound in the 3800 block of SE 14th Street in reverse. The Des Moines Police Department on Wednesday released the name of a man killed in a crash during a traffic stop and the officer who was also seriously injured in that crash.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"term\": \"false arrest\",\n      \"url\": \"https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/video-tells-story-of-black-ttc-rider-s-violent-arrest-crown-says-in-officer-s-assault-trial-1.5699452\",\n      \"headline\": \"Video tells story of Black TTC rider's violent arrest, Crown says in officer's assault trial\",\n      \"summary\": \"A Toronto judge trying a case where a Toronto police officer is seen on video grabbing a Black TTC rider by the throat within seconds of arriving at a call of a disturbance should use the footage as key evidence he is guilty of assault, a crown lawyer said in court Wednesday. \\\"It continued with the accused unnecessarily grounding Mr. Richards to the floor of the bus and needlessly keeping him in a prone position while he was behind his back, and it culminated with the dehumanizing use of Mr. Richards' body as a foot stool,\\\" he said. Roger Shallow told the Ontario Court of Justice that she should place little weight on testimony by other officers responding to the call alongside Detective Christopher Hutchings that the rider, Chase Richards, was aggressive and required the use of police force. Shallow was speaking in closing arguments in the case, which has received national attention in part because of the concerns of racism in the police force of Canada's largest city, and the security video taken from the TTC bus that shows much of the incident unfold. \\\"Indeed after a mere 20 seconds he became impatient with Mr. Richards and frankly decided to give him an 'attitude adjustment',\\\" Shallow said, with the young man's race a factor in the officer's decision.\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"police funding\": [\n    {\n      \"term\": \"police funding\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.indiawest.com/news/global_indian/indian-american-seattle-city-councilmember-kshama-sawant-faces-tight-race-in-recall-push/article_118dc04a-5801-11ec-9410-cbf50aca33ae.html\",\n      \"headline\": \"Indian American Seattle City Councilmember Kshama Sawant Faces Tight Race in Recall Push\",\n      \"summary\": \"Preliminary results Dec. 7 showed Seattle voters narrowly in favor of recalling socialist City Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a firebrand who pushed the city to adopt a $15 minimum wage, raged against hometown tech giant Amazon for its business practices and angered many with her aggressive political tactics.
